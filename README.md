# Urimai (உரிமை)

**Voice-first welfare scheme eligibility screening for Tamil speakers.**

India runs hundreds of welfare schemes. The people they exist for are frequently the
least able to find them: eligibility lives in English PDFs behind web portals, and
reaching it assumes literacy, a smartphone, and the confidence to fill a form.

Urimai inverts that. A person sends a voice note in Tamil describing their situation in
their own words — *"I'm 65, I'm a widow, I have a small piece of land"* — and gets back a
plain-language list of the schemes they are likely to qualify for, what each one pays,
and the exact office where they can confirm it.

## Try it: [rgokulkrishna44-debug.github.io/urimai](https://rgokulkrishna44-debug.github.io/urimai/)

A web page built for elderly users, most of whom do not read English:

1. Pick a language: Tamil, Hindi, English, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali or Marathi.
2. Speak freely about yourself, in that language, or skip straight to questions.
3. Only the facts the page is sure of are kept. Everything else is asked one question at a
   time, read aloud, answered with one large button or by voice. The question that
   unblocks the most schemes is always asked first.
4. Results come back in the same language, with what you get and where to confirm it.
5. Each result opens a full-details page in that language: what the scheme is, who qualifies,
   documents to keep ready, step by step how to apply, and the official government apply link
   (checked by hand). Links like `.../urimai/#s=pm-kisan` open one scheme directly.

It runs entirely in the browser: no server, no account, nothing stored. Voice is turned
into text by the browser's own speech service. The rules engine (`docs/engine.js`) is a
port of `urimai/rules.py`, and `scripts/check_web_parity.py` runs both engines on 2,000
random profiles and fails on any difference in verdict or question order (0 today).
Translations other than English and Tamil were made with AI help and are marked as such.

## What it does not do

This is a **screening aid, not a decision**. It cannot grant or deny anything, and it is
built so that it cannot pretend otherwise:

- Every verdict is `likely_eligible`, `possibly_eligible`, `unlikely` or `excluded` —
  never "you are entitled to this".
- Every scheme carries the office where a human confirms it.
- Every rule is a transcribed prior from public guidelines, and says so.

Getting this wrong has a real cost. Telling someone they qualify when they don't sends
them on a wasted trip they may have taken unpaid leave for.

## The two design decisions that matter

### 1. Unknown is not "no"

The naive version of this app models each fact as a boolean, and a person who hasn't yet
mentioned their ration card silently fails every BPL-gated scheme. That failure mode
lands hardest on exactly the users the project exists for.

So every applicant fact is three-valued — true, false, or **not yet asked** — and the
engine propagates unknowns to a verdict of `possibly_eligible` plus a follow-up question.
`test_unknown_is_not_false` pins this: an empty profile must never produce a definitive
rejection.

Follow-up questions are then ordered by **information gain** — the field blocking the most
schemes is asked first. For a 65-year-old widow, that surfaces the ration-card question
ahead of nine others, because it alone gates five schemes.

### 2. The model extracts; it does not decide

A language model is used exactly once, at the boundary, to turn free Tamil speech into a
typed form. Every eligibility decision downstream is made by ordinary, auditable,
deterministic code in `urimai/rules.py`.

The same profile always yields the same verdict, each verdict traces to the rule that
produced it, and nothing drifts when a model or temperature changes. The extraction
prompt is also instructed to **omit** anything it isn't confident about, because a missing
fact becomes a question, while a wrong fact silently denies someone a benefit.

---

## Running it

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn urimai.api:app --reload      # http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
pytest -q                            # 30 tests
```

No API key is required. Without one, extraction falls back to a conservative regex parser
that fills a field only on an unambiguous signal — degraded, but working and honest about
it. To enable LLM extraction:

```bash
export URIMAI_API_KEY=...            # Groq or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
export URIMAI_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

### API

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/assess` | `{"text": "..."}` → assessment |
| `POST /api/assess/audio` | voice note → transcript → assessment |
| `GET /api/schemes` | the scheme catalogue |
| `GET /api/health` | liveness + scheme count |

The audio route returns **503 when no transcription backend is configured**, rather than
pretending to have heard something.

### Voice input

Two backends, tried in order:

```bash
# 1. Hosted (Groq whisper-large-v3) - handles Tamil well, nothing to install
export URIMAI_STT_KEY=gsk_...

# 2. Local, no network, audio never leaves the machine
pip install faster-whisper
```

`GET /api/health` reports `"transcription": "ready" | "not configured"`. Language
defaults to Tamil (`URIMAI_STT_LANG=ta`); set it empty to auto-detect.

A fabricated transcript becomes a fabricated eligibility result, so when no backend is
available the API fails loudly instead of guessing.

## Layout

```
urimai/
  models.py     three-valued applicant profile, verdicts
  rules.py      deterministic engine + question ranking
  extract.py    speech -> typed facts (LLM, with regex fallback)
  api.py        FastAPI surface
data/
  schemes.yaml  10 schemes, hand-curated eligibility priors
tests/          30 tests, including regression guards
docs/           the web page (GitHub Pages): engine.js is a port of rules.py
                details.js = official links; details-<lang>.js = full-details text
scripts/        export_web_data.py (YAML -> docs/schemes.js), check_web_parity.py,
                check_details.js (every scheme has full details in all 8 languages)
```

To add a scheme, edit `data/schemes.yaml` only — no code change is needed. Conditions
support `min`, `max`, `eq`, `in`, `is_true`, `is_false`, plus absolute `exclusions`.

## Two bugs worth recording

Both were found by testing, and both would have failed silently in production against the
exact users this serves:

1. **The widow pension accepted men.** The rules checked marital status but not gender, so
   a male applicant with unknown marital status surfaced as a widow-pension candidate.
   Guarded by `test_widow_pension_requires_female`.

2. **Tamil ages were dropped entirely.** The age pattern ended in `\b`, but `வயது` ends in
   a combining vowel mark that Python's `\w` does not classify as a word character, so the
   boundary never matched and every Tamil-stated age was discarded — while English ages
   parsed fine. Guarded by `test_tamil_age_is_extracted`.

The second one is the more instructive: an English-only test suite would have passed
completely while the feature was broken for its entire intended audience.

3. **A 65-year-old widow was offered a girls' higher-education scholarship.** Not a
   logic error - three-valued logic did exactly what it should, since her student status
   was unknown. But "correct" and "sane" are different bars, and one absurd row
   discredits every sound row beside it. Fixed with an explicit *plausibility* bound,
   documented as such in the scheme data so nobody mistakes it for a statutory rule.

## Status and limits

- 30 tests passing; engine and API verified end-to-end with Tamil input.
- **The scheme data is a prior, not an authority.** 10 schemes are encoded; guidelines
  change and local implementation varies. Verify against the linked source before relying
  on any result.
- **Voice input has now been run end-to-end against Tamil audio** (2026-08-24), using the
  local `faster-whisper` backend on synthesised Tamil speech. It works, and running it
  found three real bugs that every English test had passed straight through:
  - Spoken numbers were dropped. The age pattern required digits, but speech yields
    `அறுபத்தி ஐந்து`, never `65`. This is the same English-shaped assumption as the
    original `\b`-after-`வயது` fault, one layer up. `urimai/numerals.py` now parses
    Tamil cardinals, including sandhi-fused forms like `இருபத்தியிரண்டு` (22).
  - The state was never extracted from Tamil at all. The pattern ended in `\b`, and
    `தமிழ்நாடு` ends in the combining mark `ு` - so the *original bug was still live in a
    second place*, untouched by the fix that made it famous. It now matches the stem, so
    inflected speech (`தமிழ்நாட்டில்`) is recognised too.
  - Household income was in the LLM schema but the heuristic never filled it, leaving
    every means-tested scheme permanently on "unknown" whenever the model was off.
- **Known limit: transcription accuracy is the ceiling now, not parsing.** On the `small`
  model, `தமிழ்நாட்டில்` came back as `தமர் நாட்டில்` and an age as `அறுபத்தேன்து`. The
  parser handles both correctly once transcribed correctly. Use `URIMAI_STT_KEY` with
  Groq `whisper-large-v3`, or set `URIMAI_STT_LOCAL_MODEL=medium`, for real deployments.
- **Still untested against a human speaker.** The audio above was synthesised. Real
  speakers bring accent, noise and dialect that TTS does not.
- Eligibility for SECC-based schemes (Ayushman Bharat) is approximated by a BPL flag; the
  real criteria are deprivation indicators this profile does not capture.
